# Back Story
After attempting to create an API from scratch using Express.js, MySQL, and Node.js, I encountered a significant failure. Despite having a basic understanding of these technologies, implementing them comprehensively proved to be a complex and bewildering task. Despite my efforts to troubleshoot and resolve the emerging issues, I couldn't achieve the desired outcome.

This failure made me realize that developing a reliable and efficient API requires a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and broader experience in utilizing these technologies. While I appreciate the effort I put into trying to build my own API, this setback has motivated me to seek alternative solutions.

Therefore, I decided to utilize the existing GitHub API as a substitute. By leveraging the GitHub API, I can access and manipulate repository data along with a wide range of available features. This allows me to focus on developing applications or projects without wasting excessive time and effort on technical hurdles.

Although I experienced failure in attempting to create my own API, I view it as a valuable learning experience. I remain enthusiastic about continuing to learn and improve my knowledge and skills in API development, as well as utilizing existing resources to achieve desired goals.

## Whati is API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. An API specifies how different software components should interact, defining the methods, data formats, and conventions to be used.

APIs enable developers to access certain functionalities or data of a software system or service without having to understand the internal workings of that system. They provide a standardized way for different applications, services, or platforms to exchange information and request specific actions.

APIs can be found in various contexts, such as web development, mobile app development, operating systems, and cloud services. They allow developers to integrate third-party services, retrieve and manipulate data, automate tasks, and build new applications on top of existing systems.

In simpler terms, an API acts as a bridge that enables different software components to communicate and work together, providing developers with a way to access and utilize the functionalities of another software system or service.
